We are systems programmers living in New Orleans, LA. We [meet once a month](/time-and-place/) for a presentation
and discussion about systems programming. This meetup is to bring together the local people who have this knowledge 
as well as potentially motivate some in the developer community to dig below their abstractions.

## What is Systems Programming?

We mostly follow the [Wikipedia definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_programming), however, we are not interested in
strictly following a theme and instead we want to follow the spirit of systems programming which is about curiosity of
how our computers and underlying systems work.

## Submitting a talk

Reach out to [Ben](mailto:bhelx@simst.im). If you are new and willing to learn and talk about it, but aren't sure what to do, we'd love for you to
try something and come present your findings. Here are some ideas that could be fun:

* Make your own simple programming language
* Make a database
* Make a small virtual machine
* Make a simple OS
* Make a computer from logic gates
