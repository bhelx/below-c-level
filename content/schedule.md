## 2025-06-03T18:00:00-05:00 - Patrick Trainer - Beyond `SELECT *`: Forcing DuckDB-WASM to Render 3D Graphics via SQL

As a backend data engineer, I asked a "what if": could [SQL](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/sql/), specifically [DuckDB-WASM](https://duckdb.org/2021/10/29/duckdb-wasm.html), handle the heavy lifting of 3D graphics rendering in a browser? This talk explores the journey of building a text-based Doom clone where the database is the world, game logic is pure SQL, and even the 3D [ray casting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting#:~:text=Ray%20casting%20greatly%20simplified%20image,the%20objects%20in%20the%20scene.) happens in a VIEW. We'll look at how recursive CTEs became a rendering engine, how JavaScript was used for orchestration and sprite [Z-buffering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-buffering), and the performance lessons learned from this unconventional marriage of data processing and frontend architecture.

## 2025-04-01T18:00:00-05:00 - Jeff Read - An Implementation of the Deflate Algorithm

Jeff Read will be discussing the
[Deflate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflate) algorithm, a general data
compression algorithm first developed by Phil Katz for his
[PKZIP](https://www.pkware.com/products/pkzip) software, and now widely used in
the PNG image format, gzip compressed files, and other applications. Mr. Read
will present an implementation of the algorithm he wrote in
[Scheme](https://www.scheme.org/) and talk about the details of the
implementation and the challenges he faced writing it.

## 2025-03-11T18:00:00-06:00 - <ins>[Front End Party](http://www.frontendparty.com/)</ins> && Below C Level Crossover Episode

This will be an extended meetup ‚Äì 6-8pm, starting promptly.

FEP && BCL are joining forces to make a Thing. There will be teams! If you ever wanted to explore the world of Arduino/microcontrollers, this will be a fun one!

## 2025-02-04T18:00:00-06:00 - <ins>[Flora Petterson](https://codebeamnyc.com/participants/flora-petterson/)</ins> -¬†Building a Highly Available, Distributed Streaming System Using Only Elixir and The BEAM

The [Publish-Subscribe Messaging Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) is an extremely valuable architectural tool in building scalable applications. However, the standard practice of relying on external brokers to manage queuing for incoming messages adds an unnecessary dependency into your system. Instead, you can utilize the benefits of a continuously available system powered by the [Erlang VM](https://www.erlang.org/blog/a-brief-beam-primer/)¬†to safely and reliably store messages from a publication within your application until they are sent to a subscriber. In this talk, I will share lessons learned from working on [HCA‚Äôs Waterpark](https://elixirmerge.com/p/improving-healthcare-outcomes-with-elixirs-actor-model), a data integration engine that uses [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)¬†and the [BEAM](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/blog/the-beam-erlangs-virtual-machine/)¬†to be a continuously available streaming system using a [distributed database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_database) that never touches disk.

## 2025-01-07T18:00:00-06:00 - <ins>[Adam Chalmers](https://adamchalmers.com/)</ins> - Vote on a Talk

[Adam Chalmers](https://adamchalmers.com/) will present one of the following two talks. We'll vote on which one to hear at pizza time.

- Building your own programming language
- ~~Keeping API servers, clients, and schemas in sync by generating them programmatically from their definition or code~~

## 2024-08-06T18:00:00-05:00 - Aaron Lee - Mob Programming a Web Server From Scratch

We are going to try something different. We can try mob programming a web server from scratch. We'll open an editor on the projector and as a group walk through some basics of HTTP. This will be a great opportunity to learn from each other. This is our first try at mob programming, if it works well there are lots of services we can try and tackle in later meetings.

Please note the change in location, we will be at SCALE, the same location as Front End Party. They have free coworking on Tuesdays if you bring fruit share. Some of us will be at SCALE before the meetup.

## 2024-03-05T18:00:00-06:00 - Vanessa Pyne - lo-fi spy: video, steganography, and you

One time I internet searched the term ‚Äústeganography‚Äù, thinking it was the study of where dinosaurs lived, but discovered it is actually the practice of hiding secret information inside a non-secret message. There are three qualities of a good steganography approach: imperceptibility, robustness, and embedding capacity. I thought to myself, that sounds like dope spy stuff and I definitely want to do that. It turns out video can be a fantastic non-secret message format in which to conceal covert messages. There are a few common approaches to make data undetectable, including bit manipulation ie the Least Significant Bit algorithm, as well as exploitation of error codes and of course, AI. Oh and there is this cool cryptographic concept of secret sharing, which can be used in video steganography to ensure the message is retrievable, even if some of the secret bits are missing. And embedding capacity is almost a given, as video files are often large and compressed. This talk (originally given at Demuxed in October) will go more in depth into how these methods work but don‚Äôt worry, the scary LSB and secret sharing maths will be softened with jokes and gifs.

We had some lightning talks

## 2023-12-05T18:00:00-06:00 - Dominique Saulet - WebAssembly Unpacked: A Guide to Wasm

Perhaps you‚Äôve heard of WebAssembly (Wasm) and all of the associated refrains: virtual Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), web standard, stack-based virtual machine, fantasy computer, and compilation target. Perhaps you‚Äôve been told of its feature set: sandboxed security, highly performant and portable byte code format, and perhaps even, you‚Äôve heard the prophecies: the holy grail of 'write once, run anywhere' (sorry Java), the common denominator for all compute, a bridge from languages, high and low, to platforms in the cloud and off to the far edge. But the truth, you see, is that Wasm is here. It‚Äôs all around you. Even now, in your browser, in your streaming services, in your serverless functions, extending your SaaS platforms, and running your AI models. And so, together, let‚Äôs unpack this alien tech and all of the arcane words that describe it, bit by bit, byte by byte, to discover what strange mechanisms make it tick, and what it means for the future.

## 2023-08-01T18:00:00-06:00 - Dan Philips: Filesystems, Everywhere

This week we have Dan Phillips talking about Wasm and filesystems. Here is the abstract:

Title: Filesystems, Everywhere

WebAssembly, described by some as the ‚ÄúFinal Abstraction,‚Äù allows for a lot of opportunity to improve upon many of the basic building blocks of computing, as we know them today. One of the most prominent of these is filesystems.

The unix philosophy that ‚Äúeverything is a file‚Äù is a fundamental idea that powers platforms that currently run a huge amount of software. If we want Wasm to be a deployment target for existing applications, we have to grapple with this fact and figure out how we intend to approach the problem of filesystems and filesystem-like entities in this new platform.

One approach: A WebAssembly-first Filesystem. This talk will discuss the rationale for and development of the `wasm-vfs` and `wasm-libc` projects that allow for the use of a standard filesystem, virtualized, all within a Wasm module. We will also examine how this new paradigm can be enabled by and further expanded with new features planned for the Wasm spec around virtualization, ‚Äúshare-everything‚Äù dynamic linking, and resource handles and types.

A WebAssembly-powered computing platform allows us to think outside of the distinctions of Userspace and Kernelspace ‚Äì so why not see how far that can take us? Starting with filesystems, we‚Äôll see how some of the same concepts of virtualization from the kernel can be applied to new environments where a filesystem can exists close to your users, your application, on the cloud, and on devices, all without worrying about the all-too-familiar costs of syscall execution in traditional Operating Systems.
