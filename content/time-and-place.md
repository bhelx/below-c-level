## Time

*Below C Level* is the *first Tuesday* of *every month* and occurs from *6:00 PM - 7:30 PM [Central Time](https://dateful.com/convert/usa-central-time?t=6pm&tz2=EST-EDT-Eastern-Time)*.
We will congregate and eat food at 6:00. The talk will start at 6:30 and last one hour.
Afterwards, some of us may walk down to the bar for a drink and combine with the folks
at NOLA Hack Night.

## Location

<!-- > **Note**: All talks will be streamed and recorded to [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/digraph) -->

If you want to attend in meatspace, you'll need to get to
[Scale](https://scaleneworleans.com/) in New Orleans, LA.

Arriving at 6pm or later? See [#I'm Locked Out!](#im-locked-out), below.

The bar we will walk to afterwards is called [The Rusty Nail](http://www.rustynailnola.com/). It's a 7 minute walk from the venue.

## I'm Locked Out!

Scale closes at 5pm, so the doors will be locked when you arrive at 6pm. Please ping the `#below-c-level` channel in the [`Nola devs`](https://join.slack.com/t/nola/shared_invite/zt-2wwyu8rif-TCXX17XO~xSet3MCheK8uw) workspace on Slack. Someone will come open the door.

## Parking

We recommend you do not drive here and instead take public transportation, but we understand that is not feasible or comfortable for everyone.
The #11 bus drops you off 10ft from the front door.

### Free Parking

There is usually free street parking available in the area. Metered spots will require payment but you should only need to pay for 1 hour as all meters stop collecting at 7PM. 

Try St Joseph Street on the North-side of the CAC building. Or if you plan to go to the bar after, you can park near the bar and walk to Scale.

### Paid Parking

If you are willing to pay for parking, or would feel safer being right by the venue, I'd recommend the `P139` lot, just across the street. It's often full from visitors to the WWII museum but the museum closes at 5PM.
