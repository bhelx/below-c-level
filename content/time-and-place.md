Enter the building using the glass doors on Camp St and take the elevator to the 3rd floor.
There is a glass door that is somtimes locked that takes you into a lobby area.
The event is within eyeshot of the door so someone should see you and let you in.

The bar we will walk to afterwards is called [The Rusty Nail](http://www.rustynailnola.com/). It's a 7 minute walk from the venue. This is completely optional but we can't reserve the room all night.

## I'm Late and Locked Out!

If you find yourself late or locked out of the building, please ping Benjamin or Aaron on Slack. We can buzz you in remotely.

## Parking

I can't provide guaranteed advice yet, but I will seek advice from drivers.
I recommend you do not drive here and instead take public transportation, but I understand that is not feasible or comfortable for everyone.

### Free Parking

There is usually free street parking available in the area. Metered spots will require payment but you should only need to pay for 1 hour as all meters stop collecting at 7PM. 

I'd try St Joseph Street on the North-side of the CAC building. Or if you plan to go to the bar after, you can park near the bar and walk to the shop.

### Paid Parking

If you are willing to pay for parking, or would feel safer being right by the venue, I'd recommend the `P139` lot. It's on the same block and side of the street
as the venue. It's often full from visitors to the WWII museum but the museum closes at 5PM.
