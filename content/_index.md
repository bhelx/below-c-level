We are systems programmers living in New Orleans, LA. We [meet once a month](/time-and-place/) for a presentation
and discussion about systems programming. This meetup is to bring together the local people who have this knowledge 
as well as potentially motivate some in the developer community to dig below their abstractions.

See [Time & Place](/time-and-place) and [About](/about) for more info.
