We are systems programmers living in New Orleans, LA. We [meet once a month](/time-and-place/) for a presentation
and discussion about systems programming. This meetup brings together local people who are interested in systems programming.
We welcome anyone interested in digging below their abstractions and learning about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_programming">systems programming</a>. The talks are written for a programmer with a few years of professional experience, if anything is confusing or unclear we have time for discussions and group learning.

See [Time & Place](/time-and-place) and [About](/about) for more info.
